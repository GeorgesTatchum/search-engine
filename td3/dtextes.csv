The novel coronavirus disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which belongs to the coronaviridae family. In this paper, a comparative genomic analysis of eight coronaviruses namely Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Bat coronavirus RaTG13 has been carried out using Chaos Game Representation and Fisher-Shannon Complexity (CGR-FSC) measure. Chaos Game Representation (CGR) is a unique alignment-free method to visualize one dimensional DNA sequence in a two-dimensional fractal-like pattern. The two-dimensional CGR pattern is then quantified by Fisher-Shannon Complexity (FSC) measure. The CGR-FSC can effectively identify the viruses uniquely and their similarity/dissimilarity can be revealed in the Fisher-Shannon Information Plane (FSIP)."

Interdisciplinary research can provide an effective solution to complex issues in the related field of coronavirus. However, whether coronavirus related research becomes more interdisciplinary still needs corroboration. In this study, we investigate interdisciplinary status of the coronavirus-related fields via the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). To this end, we calculate bibliometric indicators of interdisciplinarity and a co-occurrence analysis method. The results show that co-occurrence relationships between cited disciplines have evolved dynamically over time. The two types of co-occurrence relationships, Immunology and Microbiology & Medicine and Chemical Engineering & Chemistry, last for a long time in this field during 1990-2020. Moreover, the number of disciplines cited by coronavirus-related research increases, whereas the distribution of disciplines is uneven, and this field tends to focus on several dominant disciplines such as Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology. We also gauge the disciplinary diversity of COVID-19 related papers published from January to December 2020; the disciplinary variety shows an upward trend, while the degree of disciplinary balance shows a downward trend. Meanwhile, the comprehensive index 2Ds demonstrates that the degree of interdisciplinarity in coronavirus field decreases between 1990 and 2019, but it increases in 2020. The results help to map the interdisciplinarity of coronavirus-related research, gaining insight into the degree and history of interdisciplinary cooperation."

Genes acting as repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1) were then employed to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed to mitigate the coronavirus infection. Present analyses identify Vitamin D and Quercetin as promising pandemic mitigation agents. Gene expression profiles of Vitamin D and Quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances suggest that they may represent viable candidates for further assessment and considerations of their potential as coronavirus pandemic mitigation agents. Notably, gene set enrichment analyses and expression profiling experiments identify multiple drugs, most notably testosterone, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of Testosterone versus Estradiol impacts on SCARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during coronavirus pandemic."

From an initial individual (the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates, creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either. Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations, when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people, the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a parallel multi-virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models, in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance."

Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design and vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a genome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate gene expression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity, genome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an abundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in the gene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein gene undergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution. Comparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in the spike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat distribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature.

These new findings are slow to translate to clinical interventions, leading to poorer patient outcomes and unnecessary deaths. One reason is that clinicians, overwhelmed by patients, struggle to keep pace with the rate of new coronavirus literature. A potential solution is developing a tool for evaluating coronavirus literature using large language models (LLMs) -- neural networks that are deployed for natural language processing. LLMs can be used to summarize and extract user-specified information. The greater availability and advancement of LLMs and pre-processed coronavirus literature databases provide the opportunity to assist clinicians in evaluating coronavirus literature through a coronavirus literature specific LLM (covLLM), a tool that directly takes an inputted research article and a user query to return an answer. Using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), we produced two datasets: (1) synCovid, which uses a combination of handwritten prompts and synthetic prompts generated using OpenAI, and (2) real abstracts, which contains abstract and title pairs. covLLM was trained with LLaMA 7B as a baseline model to produce three models trained on (1) the Alpaca and synCovid datasets, (2) the synCovid dataset, and (3) the synCovid and real abstract datasets.

Using 973,940 revisions from 134,337 editors to 4,238 articles, this study examines the dynamics of the English Wikipedia's response to the coronavirus pandemic through the first five months of 2020 as a ""quantitative portrait"" describing the emergent collaborative behavior at three levels of analysis: article revision, editor contributions, and network dynamics. Across multiple data sources, quantitative methods, and levels of analysis, we find four consistent themes characterizing Wikipedia's unique large-scale, high-tempo, and temporary online collaborations: external events as drivers of activity, spillovers of activity, complex patterns of editor engagement, and the shadows of the future. In light of increasing concerns about online social platforms' abilities to govern the conduct and content of their users, we identify implications from Wikipedia's coronavirus collaborations for improving the resilience of socio-technical systems during a crisis."

In this study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media, politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations, business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians. As we make the dataset available to the community, we hope the advertising domain will become an important part of quality control for public health communication and public discourse in general."

The framework introduced and the method proposed in this paper are on the basis of the theory of rational choice at a societal level, which assumes that the government is a rational, benevolent agent that systematically and purposefully takes into account the social marginal costs and social marginal benefits of its actions to its citizens and makes decisions that maximize the society's well-being as a whole.

Materials and Methods: Multiple international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19 thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results: Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over time. Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a larger population, demonstrated that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis can achieve high accuracy in detection of Coronavirus as well as quantification and tracking of disease burden."

However, human-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission cannot be ignored, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread rapidly in farmed and wild animals. This could create a worrying cycle of SARS-CoV-2 spillover from humans to animals and spillback of new strains back into humans, rendering vaccines ineffective. This study provides a key indicator of animals that may be potential susceptible hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus infections by analysing the phylogenetic distance between host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the coronavirus spike protein. Crucially, our analysis identifies animals that are at elevated risk from a spillover and spillback incident. One group of animals has been identified as potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by harbouring a parasitic coronavirus spike protein similar to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These animals may serve as amplification hosts in spillover events from zoonotic reservoirs. Tracing interspecies transmission in multi-host environments based solely on in vitro and in vivo examinations of animal susceptibility or serology is a time-consuming task. This approach allows rapid identification of high-risk animals to prioritize research and assessment of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission in the environment. It is a tool to rapidly identify zoonotic species that may cause outbreaks or participate in expansion cycles of coexistence with their hosts. This prevents the spread of coronavirus infections between species, preventing spillover and spillback incidents from occurring."

In current circumstances, a solution must be developed to control or stop the spread of the virus. For this purpose, a novel technique based on call data record analysis (CDRA)and contact tracing is proposed that can effectively control the coronavirus outbreak. A positive coronavirus patient can be traced through CDRA and contact tracing. The technique can track the path traversed by the patient and collect the cell numbers of all those people who have met with the patient. Keeping in tact the privacy of this group of people, who are contacted through their cell numbers so that they can isolate themselves till the result of their coronavirus test arrives. If a test result of a person comes positive among the group, then he/she must be isolated and same CDRA and contact tracing procedures are adopted for that person. A COVID-19 patient is geo tagged and alerts are sent if any violation of isolation is done by the patient. Moreover, the general public is informed in advance to avoid the path followed by the patients. This cost effective mechanism is not only capable to control the coronavirus outbreak but also helps in isolating the patient in his/her house."

Experiments suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of four single mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory experimentally. The theory also works well for the newer strains and explains their increased contagiousness.

We analyzed conserved domains of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV2] for possible targets of viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human coronavirus [229E] and zoonotic coronaviruses with SAR-CoV2 as well as evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV 2 genomic data. Conserved domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms in SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of the spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses alongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary relationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed between Wuhan SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines as early ancestors. Therefore, phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside migration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks."

There is therefore a tremendous need to address and better understand COVID-19's informational crisis and gauge public sentiment, so that appropriate messaging and policy decisions can be implemented. In this research article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic using Coronavirus specific Tweets and R statistical software, along with its sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the progress of fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United States, using descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data visualizations. Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91% for short Tweets, with the Naive Bayes method. We also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74% with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets.

In particular, two ""new"" communities, /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus, emerged on Reddit and have been dedicated to COVID- related discussions from the very beginning of this pandemic. With /r/Coronavirus promoted as the official community on Reddit, it remains an open question how users choose between these two highly-related communities.   In this paper, we characterize user trajectories in these two communities from the beginning of COVID-19 to the end of September 2020. We show that new users of /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus were similar from January to March. After that, their differences steadily increase, evidenced by both language distance and membership prediction, as the pandemic continues to unfold. Furthermore, users who started at /r/China flu from January to March were more likely to leave, while those who started in later months tend to remain highly ""loyal"". To understand this difference, we develop a movement analysis framework to understand membership changes in these two communities and identify a significant proportion of /r/China flu members (around 50%) that moved to /r/Coronavirus in February. This movement turns out to be highly predictable based on other subreddits that users were previously active in. Our work demonstrates how two highly-related communities emerge and develop their own identity in a crisis, and highlights the important role of existing communities in understanding such an emergence."

Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions."

To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides, and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits dinucleotide TT islands in the non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the dinucleotide regions suggests that the dinucleotide repeats are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus.

The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations.

Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we address the role of Tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that Tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Tetracycline-RBD, 5.59 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Chloroquine-RBD, 5.16 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Doxycycline-RBD). Stronger Tetracycline inhibition is verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the Tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline appears to target viral residues that are usually involved in significant hydrogen bonding with ACE2; this inhibition of cellular infection complements the anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of Tetracycline, and may further reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2."

Being dealt with area normalization method, the fitting curves could be regarded as a kind of probability density function (PDF), its mathematical expectation and the variance could be used to analyze the situation of the coronavirus pandemic. Numerical experiments based on the data of certain countries have indicated that the QDF method demonstrate the intrinsic characteristics of COVID-19 data of the given country or distric, and because of the interval of data used in this paper is over one year (500 days), it reveals the fact that after multi-wave transmission of the coronavirus, the case fatality rate has declined obviously, the result shows that as an appraisal method, it is effective and feasible."

A robust and automatic early recognition of COVID-19, via auxiliary computer-aided diagnostic tools, is essential for disease cure and control. The chest radiography images, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray, and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be a significant and useful material for designing such tools. However, designing such an automated tool is challenging as a massive number of manually annotated datasets are not publicly available yet, which is the core requirement of supervised learning systems. In this article, we propose a robust CNN-based network, called CVR-Net (Coronavirus Recognition Network), for the automatic recognition of the coronavirus from CT or X-ray images. The proposed end-to-end CVR-Net is a multi-scale-multi-encoder ensemble model, where we have aggregated the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to obtain the final prediction probability. We train and test the proposed CVR-Net on three different datasets, where the images have collected from different open-source repositories. We compare our proposed CVR-Net with state-of-the-art methods, which are trained and tested on the same datasets. We split three datasets into five different tasks, where each task has a different number of classes, to evaluate the multi-tasking CVR-Net. Our model achieves an overall F1-score & accuracy of 0.997 & 0.998; 0.963 & 0.964; 0.816 & 0.820; 0.961 & 0.961; and 0.780 & 0.780, respectively, for task-1 to task-5.

Designing and monitoring interventions to slow and stop the spread of the virus require knowledge of how many people have been and are currently infected, where they live, and how they interact. The first step is an accurate assessment of the population prevalence of past infections. There are very few population-representative prevalence studies of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and only two American states -- Indiana and Connecticut -- have reported probability-based sample surveys that characterize state-wide prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. One of the difficulties is the fact that the tests to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antibodies are new, not well characterized, and generally function poorly. During July, 2020, a survey representing all adults in the State of Ohio in the United States collected biomarkers and information on protective behavior related to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Several features of the survey make it difficult to estimate past prevalence: 1) a low response rate, 2) very low number of positive cases, and 3) the fact that multiple, poor quality serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We describe a new Bayesian approach for analyzing the biomarker data that simultaneously addresses these challenges and characterizes the potential effect of selective response. The model does not require survey sample weights, accounts for multiple, imperfect antibody test results, and characterizes uncertainty related to the sample survey and the multiple, imperfect, potentially correlated tests."

In this paper, we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus.

Here, we examine informationseeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. By using an eventstudy framework, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away, but the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements were followed by increasingly strong measures. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing), or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are encouraging given our study period is relatively early in the epidemic and more elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis will track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information."

They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources.

For many whose distant ancestors moved to temperate climes, these adaptations proved harmful: pigmentation decreased by natural selection and susceptibility to hypertension emerged. Now an added risk is lung inflammation from coronavirus that may be furthered by innate immune differences. Hypertension and coronavirus have in common angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which decreases blood pressure and mediates virus entry. In keeping with less detailed studies, a long-term case-report shows that decreased blood pressure induced by blocking a primary angiotensin receptor is supplemented, above critical blocker dosage, by a further temperature-dependent fall, likely mediated by ACE2 and secondary angiotensin receptors. Temperature-dependence suggests a linkage with tropical heritage and an influence of blockers on the progress of coronavirus infections. Positive therapeutic results should result from negation of host pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the primary angiotensin receptor and concomitant promotion of countervailing anti-inflammatory effects mediated by ACE2 through other receptors. These effects may involve innate immune system components (lectin complement pathway, NAD metabolome). Black vulnerability - more likely based on physiological than on socioeconomic differences - provides an important clue that may guide treatments."

We also find that men less than women believe that they will be seriously affected by the coronavirus, and this partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering (this is particularly ironic because official statistics actually show that men are affected by the COVID-19 more seriously than women). Finally, we also find gender differences in self-reported negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering.

Indeed, a recently conducted study~\cite{ref2} has reported that 79\% of the confirmed infections in China were caused by undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of symptoms, it has also been reported that the known number of infections is not representative of the real number of infected people (the actual number is expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients.

Results reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind speed and a high wind energy production in MW have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less cleaner production have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence of viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection cannot be solved only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable development. Overall, then, this study has to conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in society."

Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved drugs that has the advantage (over conventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that time frame of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the few number of clinical trial required.

Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social distancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in intra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating coronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to consider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by incorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel metapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth patterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to policy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple Mobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of model-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban ""superspreading"", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary infections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and heightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can facilitate location-aware mobility reduction policy that more effectively mitigates disease transmission at similar social cost. Finally, we demonstrate our model can serve as a fine-grained analytic and simulation framework that informs the design of rational non-pharmaceutical interventions policies."

To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy."

There are a limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the increasing cases daily. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people. In this study, five pre-trained convolutional neural network based models (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. We have implemented three different binary classifications with four classes (COVID-19, normal (healthy), viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia) by using 5-fold cross validation. Considering the performance results obtained, it has seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance (96.1% accuracy for Dataset-1, 99.5% accuracy for Dataset-2 and 99.7% accuracy for Dataset-3) among other four used models."

On 31st December 2019, it was first reported to country office of World Health Organization (WHO) in China. Since then, it has spread to most of the countries around the globe. However, there has been a recent rise in trend in believing that it would go away during summer days, which has not yet been properly investigated. In this paper, relationship of daily number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with three environmental factors, viz. maximum relative humidity (RH_max), maximum temperature (T_max) and highest wind speed (WS_max), considering the incubation period, have been investigated statistically, for four of the most affected places of China, viz. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan and five of the most affected places of Italy, viz. Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano. It has been found that the relationship with maximum relative humidity and highest wind is mostly negligible, whereas relationship with maximum temperature is ranging between negligible to moderate."

Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomain of the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region, followed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similarity between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication of this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation in the coronavirus research field making use of an already-established literature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, respiratory infections and the hepcidin protein. The question of possible homology and an evolutionary connection between the viral spike protein and hepcidin is not assessed in this report, but some scenarios for its study are discussed."

As of July 2020, no specific drugs or vaccines are yet available for COVID-19, fast and accurate diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 is essential in slowing down the spread of COVID-19 and for efficient implementation of control and containment strategies. Magnetic immunoassay is a novel and emerging topic representing the frontiers of current biosensing and magnetics areas. The past decade has seen rapid growth in applying magnetic tools for biological and biomedical applications. Recent advances in magnetic materials and nanotechnologies have transformed current diagnostic methods to nanoscale and pushed the detection limit to early stage disease diagnosis. Herein, this review covers the literatures of magnetic immunoassay platforms for virus and pathogen detections, before COVID-19. We reviewed the popular magnetic immunoassay platforms including magnetoresistance (MR) sensors, magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Magnetic Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic kits are also reviewed aiming at developing plug-and-play diagnostics to manage the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as well as preventing future epidemics. In addition, other platforms that use magnetic materials as auxiliary tools for enhanced pathogen and virus detections are also covered. The goal of this review is to inform the researchers of diagnostic and surveillance platforms for SARS-CoV-2 and their performances."

To conduct the study, data on mobility patterns, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people, lockdown measures, and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources (e.g., Google, UNDP, UN, BBC, Oxford University, Worldometer). A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic."

Countries irrespective of economic status have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects of the lives, including health, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent the outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale lockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics, for example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings, restricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown strategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social interactions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown, psychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the Spanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology approach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in order to understand people's interaction over the months of this on-going coronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the pandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which declined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more positive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This leads us to speculate that the South American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the overall psychological distress."

Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease epidemics."

Based on phylogenetic inferences, sequence analysis and structure-function relationships of coronavirus proteins, informed by the knowledge currently available on the virus, we discuss the different scenarios evoked to account for the origin - natural or synthetic - of the virus. The data currently available is not sufficient to firmly assert whether SARS-CoV2 results from a zoonotic emergence or from an accidental escape of a laboratory strain. This question needs to be solved because it has important consequences on the evaluation of risk/benefit balance of our interaction with ecosystems, the intensive breeding of wild and domestic animals, as well as some lab practices and on scientific policy and biosafety regulations. Regardless of its origin, studying the evolution of the molecular mechanisms involved in the emergence of pandemic viruses is essential to develop therapeutic and vaccine strategies and to prevent future zoonoses.
